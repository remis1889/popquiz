## Surveyor

A web application to create surveys developed using Ruby on Rails. Features are divided into 3 sections:

* Survey Builder
* Survey Taker
* Result Viewer

A survey can have two types of questions : multiple choice questions and number range questions. A question can be required or optional. Multiple choice questions can allow the user to either select only one option (radio buttons) or many options (checkboxes).
